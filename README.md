# todotools README

todotools adds some task list management shortcuts for Taskpaper documents.

## Features

**Copy Daily Tasks to Today**
: This task will copy any tasks in a "Daily" section into a "Today" section, unless they are already there. This allows you to create daily tasks (e.g. "Feed the cat") without having to re-type them,


## Extension Settings

None. 

## Known Issues

The document must have sections for "Daily" and "Today" in standard TaskPaper syntax (starting at column 0 and ending with a colon).

    Today:
      - Task 1

    Daily:
      - Task 2
      - Task 3
